					Research is going on from ages to make a Robot which can travel on any terrain. Many changes
					are being made every year. Its the biggest challenge for any Robotist. Any real time robot which
					can travel in all terrains will be the developed version of the prototype. so put all your efforts
					together in making manual robot and try it in our arenas with all terrain.<br>
					The arena will consists of, sand, water, stones, multiple bumps, mud, uneven paths, hills,
					earthquake in between and unexpected obstacles. Design your robot which can travel on all
					these terrains.<br>
					This consists of 3 rounds. The teams which completes the arena in short time will be qualified to
					the next round. Obstacles in the terrain will be increased for every level/round.<br>
					Three teams will be the final winners, one winner and two runnerups.<br>
					Do’s and Donot’s:<br>
					Only one person should operate the robot,<br>
					If the robot falls out of the arena, a penalty with time lapse of 15 seconds will be considered.<br>
					Batteries should be only placed on the robot, batteries built in remotes are disqualified.<br>
					Do not push or pull the robots with wire, it will be disqualified in such cases.<br>
					In case of any errors in the robots, time lapse of 3minutes will be given to rectify it, un identified
					problems beyond the time limit will be disqualified.<br>
					Any metal can be used to build the chassis of the robots.<br>
					There are no restrictions with the RPM, Torque, chassis or wheels of your robot.<br>
					Touching the robot once it starts in the arena leads to penalty with time lapse of 10seconds will be
					considered.<br>

					Team size: maximum of 4 members<br>
					Certificate of merit for 1st three teams.<br>
					and Certificate of participation to all the teams.<br>

					Registration fee: 200/- per team.<br>
